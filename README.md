### Hi there, ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! 

I hold a masterâ€™s degree from the Graduate Program in Economics (PPGEco-UFSC) - with a scholarship from the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) in Brazil.
 
My research is focused on financial econometrics. Iâ€™m currently interested in the following topics: macro-finance (backward-looking and forward-looking macroeconomic factors), monetary policy, dynamic factor models, and term structure models; forecast combinations, volatility forecasting, and term structure forecasting.

I recently developed packages in R and Python to fitting and forecasting the term structure of interest rates. Finally, I have an interest in machine learning applied to financial econometrics.

You can see my cv (only in portuguese) on [http://lattes.cnpq.br/5635422378279874][1].
